# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file that defines the location of the snippet file and specifies the language of the snippets.
* `snippets/snippets.json` - the file containing all snippets.

## Get up and running straight away

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Verify that your snippets are always proposed on intellisense.

## Make changes

* You can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above.
* You can also reload (`Ctrl+R` on Linux or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes.
